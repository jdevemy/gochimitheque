Chimithèque is an open source chemical product management application initially developped by the ENS-Lyon (France).

The project has started in 2015 and has moved to Github in 2017. The old subversion repository can be found here: https://sourcesup.renater.fr/scm/viewvc.php?root=chimitheque

## Why Chimithèque?

We needed a global method to manage chemical products of the different departments and laboratories of the ENS to:

- improve the security with a precise global listing of the chemicals products stored in the entire school
- reduce waste by encouraging chemical products managers to search in Chimithèque if a product can be borrowed from another department before ordering a new one

## V2 version

This is the V2 version of the original [Chimithèque](https://github.com/tbellembois/chimitheque) project.
